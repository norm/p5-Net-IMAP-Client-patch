Net::IMAP::Client patch
=======================

This is not the original code, which is written by Joel Roth and can be found
on [CPAN](http://search.cpan.org/~ganglion/Net-IMAP-Client/).

However, there is a bug in the code that has yet to be addressed, and I need
it to work for [some tools](https://github.com/norm/imap-tools) that I use on
my mail accounts. So I am keeping this around until it is fixed.
